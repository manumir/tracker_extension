errors:

possible fix:
-when changed to another tab, write to map even if
 tab is being updated
-easy fix is at the start get all urls and set them to zero,
 and also add the newtab and set it to zero (maybe doesn't cover
 clicking on links and updating current tab)

fixed:
1-when uptaded and before its complete and changed
 to another tab which maybe is (zerod or isn't on the map), the tab which
 was updated is zerod plus the time spent on the other tab(which probably
 is zero.
